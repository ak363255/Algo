 1. DATA STRUCTURES
     Organise data so that it can be accessed quickly and usefully
 
 Ex:-List,Stacks, Queues,Heap,Search tree,HashTable,bloom filters,union find etc.
   WHY so many ?
   Ans :- Different data structure support different set of operation->Suitable for different type of task
   
   Rule of thumb :- Choose the "minimal" datstructure that support all the operation
   
   Four level of data structures
   
   level 0- What is data Structure.
   level 1- Cocktail party(knows some data structure but not using)
   level 2- using data structures
   level 3- Competetive Hard coder from scratch
   
   Talking about level 2 data structure.
   
   Heap Data Structure
   Heap :supported operation
   - Employe records and network edges and events etc
   1. INSERT:-Add a new object to the heap
   2. Extract -min- Remove an object with minimum key value
   
   Also know about Running time 
   1.Insert O(log n)
    2.Heapipy O(n)
    3. Delete O(log n)
    
    Application: Sorting
    Canonical use of heap:-Fast way to do repeated minima computation
    
    Heap Sort:
    Insert All elements in heap and extract minimum one by one
    Running time-O(n log n)
    -->optimal for comparison based soting algo
    
    2-->Event Manager
    Event Record -update record(who scored top),update Schedule for an event
    
    3--->Median Maintainence
